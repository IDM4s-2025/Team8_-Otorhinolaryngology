    "## Medical Specialty: Otorhinolaryngology\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, a medical specialty, Otolaryngology, has been assigned; using this medical specialty an expert medical diagnostic system was designed. Below is information on 12 diseases related to the specialty along with symptoms supported by medical references.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Diseases: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Acoustic neuroma\n",
    "\n",
    "An acoustic neuroma is a noncancerous tumor on the main nerve that runs from the inner ear to the brain. This nerve is called the vestibular nerve. Branches of the nerve directly affect balance and hearing. Pressure from an acoustic neuroma can cause hearing loss, ringing in the ears, and balance problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The known syntoms are:\n",
    "- Hearing loss\n",
    "- Ringing in the affected ear, known as tinnitus.\n",
    "- Loss of balance or feeling unsteady.\n",

    "- Facial numbness and, very rarely, weakness or loss of muscle movement.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Mayo Clinic, 2023)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Otitis externa\n",
    "\n",
    "Acute otitis externa (AEO), also known as swimmer's ear or swimming pool ear, is a diffuse inflammation of the external auditory canal (EAC) that can extend to the auricle or tympanic membrane. Acute bacterial infection is the most common cause of otitis externa.\n",

    "\n",
    "(Mayo Clinic, 2025)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Meniere's Disease \n",
    "\n",
    "Meniere's disease is a disorder of the inner ear that can lead to episodes of severe dizziness, known as vertigo, and hearing loss. In most cases, this condition only impacts one ear.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Frequent dizziness: a sensation of spinning that begins and ends suddenly, which can last between 20 minutes and 12 hours, and sometimes more than 24 hours. Severe dizziness can cause nausea.\n",
    "- Hearing loss: which may be intermittent at first and, over time, more permanent.\n",
    "- Tinnitus: Ringing, whistling, roaring, hissing, or ringing in the ear.\n",
    "- Feeling of fullness in the ear: A feeling of pressure or congestion in the affected ear.\n",
    "\n",
    "(Mayo Clinic, 2024)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Epistaxis\n",
    "\n",
    "Epistaxis or nosebleed is any bleeding originating from the nasal passages.  This bleeding may be caused by trauma, irritation or dryness of the lining of the nose. The main sign or symptom of epistaxis is nosebleeds. At first, epistaxis is usually scanty and of limited duration. In more severe cases, blood may flow out of one nostril and/or become bilateral as blood flows through the nostrils.\n",
    "Other symptoms of epistaxis are:\n",
    "- Sweating.\n",
    "- Dizziness.\n",
    "- Nausea and vomiting, due to swallowing blood.\n",

    "\n",
    "Nasal polyps are painless, noncancerous growths that develop inside the nose or the hollow areas within the facial bones (sinuses). They are associated with inflammation of the inside of the nose and sinuses, often linked to chronic sinusitis, which can last more than 12 weeks. These growths can range from small and asymptomatic to large and obstructive. The common symptoms are: \n",

    "### Pharyngitis\n",
    "\n",
    "Pharyngitis, or sore throat, is discomfort, pain, or scratchiness in the throat that often causes pain when swallowing.

    "### Laryngitis\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the inflammation of the voice box (larynx) caused by overuse, irritation or infection. When this happens, the cords swell, distorting the sounds produced and resulting in a hoarse voice. In some cases, the voice becomes imperceptible. The laryngitis can be either short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic). \n",
